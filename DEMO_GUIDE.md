## ðŸ”§ Quick Test Script

For a rapid demo, run the automated test script:

```bash
./test_api.sh
```

This will:
- Run through all major API endpoints
- Show successful operations
- Demonstrate permission errors
- Display data masking
- All while logging to the API Monitor tab!

## ðŸ’¡ Demo Tips

1. **Start with the UI** - It's more visual and easier to understand
2. **Show role switching** - Demonstrates RBAC clearly
3. **Use real-world scenarios** - Partner self-service, DevOps automation
4. **Keep API Monitor tab open** - Shows live activity
5. **Mention production considerations** - JWT auth, secrets management, rate limiting
6. **Show both UI and API** - Demonstrates flexibility
7. **Highlight audit trail** - Important for compliance
8. **Use the test script** - Quick way to generate activity

---

## ðŸ“Š Demo Metrics to Highlight

- **10 real suppliers** pre-configured
- **4 role types** (admin, devops, cs, partner)
- **7 API endpoints** fully functional
- **4 action types** logged (create, update, rotate, view)
- **Auto-refresh** monitoring (2-second intervals)
- **Complete audit trail** for compliance
- **Real-time synchronization** between UI and API

---

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

**API not responding?**
```bash
# Check if API is running
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

**Streamlit not showing new data?**
- Click "ðŸ”„ Refresh Now" in API Monitor tab
- Or toggle auto-refresh on

**Database empty?**
```bash
# Delete and restart to reload sample data
rm credentials.db
streamlit run app.py
```

**API logs not showing?**
- Make sure API server has been started at least once
- Run a test request to generate logs

---

## ðŸ“ž Questions to Anticipate

**Q: How would this work in production?**
A: Replace demo API keys with JWT/OAuth2, use PostgreSQL, add rate limiting, enable HTTPS, integrate with secrets management (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager).

**Q: Can this scale to hundreds of suppliers?**
A: Yes, database-backed design scales well. Can add pagination, caching, and search functionality.

**Q: How do you handle credential expiration?**
A: Can add expiration dates, automated rotation schedules, and expiry notifications.

**Q: What about multi-region support?**
A: Can add region field to credentials, deploy API to multiple regions, use geo-distributed database.

**Q: How do you ensure security?**
A: RBAC, audit logging, secret masking, encryption at rest (can be added), HTTPS, API key rotation.
